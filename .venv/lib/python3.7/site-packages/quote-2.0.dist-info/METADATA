#### About

quote is a python wrapper for the Goodreads Quote API, powered by [gazpacho](https://github.com/maxhumber/gazpacho).



#### Usage

quote is simple to use:

```python
from quote import quote

search = 'Jasper Fforde'
result = quote(search, limit=2)
print(result)

# [{'author': 'Jasper Fforde',
#   'book': 'Something Rotten',
#   'quote': 'If the real world were a book, it would never find a publisher. Overlong, detailed to the point of distraction-and ultimately, without a major resolution.'},
#  {'author': 'Jasper Fforde',
#   'book': 'The Well of Lost Plots',
#   'quote': "After all, reading is arguably a far more creative and imaginative process than writing; when the reader creates emotion in their head, or the colors of the sky during the setting sun, or the smell of a warm summer's breeze on their face, they should reserve as much praise for themselves as they do for the writer - perhaps more."}]
```

quote can also be used as a command line tool:

```
>>> max@mbp$ quote 'alain de botton'
People only get really interesting when they start to rattle the bars of their cages.

>>> max@mbp$ quote --search='alain de botton'
Intimacy is the capacity to be rather weird with someone - and finding that that's ok with them.
```



#### Installation

```
pip install -U quote
```
